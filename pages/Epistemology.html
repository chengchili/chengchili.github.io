                        and visiting scholars at MIT's Department of Architecture. The group's challenge is innovative use of computation for
                        solving problems stemmed in contexts of architectural design practice. Current projects encompass software and hardware
                        development, computer graphics content creation, and design work for architectural competitions and
                        building projects.

                      <li>This group is engaged in a broad range of work on Shape Grammars, a visual and generative
                        system for creating and describing designs on multiple levels. Work on shape and shape representation
                        at the theoretical level aims at a new computational basis for design. Work on practical applications
                        focuses on the potential of shape grammars in stylistic analysis and in the creative design process.
                        Faculty and students are also exploring the use and development of digital and web-based technologies,
                        computer software, and remote collaboration for supporting shape grammar applications..

                      <li>The Computational Making research group is articulating a new area of interdisciplinary research on
                        the processes and practices of making across contexts and scales. In recent years, there has been
                        growing interest in materials and material practices, and in “making” and “makers”,
                        usually revolving around digital fabrication. Our work aims to expand the study of making
                        beyond its current bounds. We view making as an improvisational, action-centric, embodied,
                        and situated activity. We examine the potentials of computational theories and techniques for
                        understanding and enhancing making activities.

                    The Master in Design Studies (MDes) post professional program at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design is aimed at those who want to pair their design knowledge with tools to enable careers in public service, academia, NGOs,
                    innovative ventures, as well as developing specific expertise for design practice.
                    <br><br>
                    The MDes program consists of four semesters of coursework with no studios. Applicants select one of four domains of study—Ecologies, Narratives, Publics, and Mediums—and undertake a core set of courses, including research methods
                    and related topical courses. Following that domain foundation, each student then forges an individualized trajectory, leveraging course offerings across the GSD, as well as other schools and departments at Harvard. During their
                    fourth semester, MDes students from all four domains come together to focus on collaborative advanced research in the form of open projects, in which their expertise finds application on a current issue.

                <br>Introduction
                <br>1-Every technology is social before it is technical or physical.
                <br>2-When a technology does become physical, it is not a benign
                reserve... but rather produces its own risks and problems as a
                constitutive fact of that technology.
                <br>3-Any technology is not new
                <br>4-We will know very little
                about the capabilities and culpabilities of
                technology if we only study a technology in
                terms of its technical performance

          <li><strong>What does ‘Medium’ mean in Art?</strong></li>
        <li>&emsp;  “any raw material or mode of expression used in an artistic or creative activity”</li>
        <li>&emsp;  artist employs is the ‘Medium’</li>
        <li>&emsp;  “The ‘medium’ mediates”. It translates artists’ ideas, messages or impulses thanks to their skill and sensibility. It is a vehicle for art.</li>
        <li>&emsp; The digital recording or music sheet is the code of this type of art
        <br>&emsp; Verbal Art encompasses literature and poetry
        <br>&emsp; This classification and interpretation of the ‘Medium’ is too simple for art today.
          <li><strong>1-The ‘Medium’ as a Mode of Expression</strong></li>
        <li>&emsp; As explained in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, “creation is the re-formation of these pre-existing materials”</li>
        <br>
          <li><strong>2-The ‘Medium’ as Raw Material</strong></li>
          <li>&emsp; ‘medium’ as the substance with which an artwork is created
            <br>&emsp;Artists must be skilful and know about the characteristics of the materials they use.
            <br>The way tools and techniques are used is extremely personal. So much changes
            according to which materials are used. Artists can prefer specific ones in isolation,
            or combine them to achieve different effects or textures. <strong>Some artists prefer methods
            they are familiar with </strong>due to their training and education. <strong>For other artists the choice
            is symbolic as they pick materials </strong>which are connected to memories or traditions.
            The materials can even represent something or be connected to the meaning of the work.
            Many artists even go to the extent of developing their own mediums adapting them
            to their own needs, or because they see it to be an essential part of the artistic process.
  <br>overlapping and blurring of the ‘Medium’ began to be a widespread and accepted phenomenon in the Arts.
